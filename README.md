## Main Idea

The following links explain a bit the idea of semantic search and how search mechanisms work by doing retrieve and rerank

- [Semantic Search](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html)

- [Retrieve and Rerank](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/retrieve_rerank/README.html)

## Setup
## Download trained models

There are two models trained for spanish, a bi-encoder and a cross-encoder. These serve to make the retrieval system using the retrieve and rerank idea:

```
make download_models
```


## Model architecture


## Training

## Finetuning
